        Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
        
        Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
        Output: true
        Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
